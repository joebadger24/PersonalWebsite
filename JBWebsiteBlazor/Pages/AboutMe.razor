                Description="Worked at System C Healthcare Ltd (www.systemc.com) as a software engineer. Collaborated with both the Interfacing and Research & Development departments.
                            Within Interfacing, I worked as part of a SCRUM team to fix bugs in the existing client interface.
                            Worked with R+D to develop a Blazor web application to act as a tool for the support team.
                            Responsible for developing the front and back end of the web app, which connected to a web service that was built by the lead engineer.
                            Met the requirements of the support team, and the specification set out by the lead engineer.
                            This internship was an excellent first experience in software engineering and helped to improve my technical skills and understanding."

                Detail="Rendel Ltd - (Aug 2021 - Jul 2022)"
                Description="Worked at Rendel Ltd (www.rendel-ltd.com) as an undergraduate civil engineer.
                            Worked as part of the bridges team, most of the year working on the category three checks of the viaducts that are being built as part of HS2 Project.
                            This role involved creating 3D models of the bridges for Finite Element Analysis, using Excel spreadsheets to analyse, and perform calculations on structural
                            members and writing Python scripts that would help to input thousands of rows of data into modelling software. This placement was extremely beneficial to my
                            problem-solving skills and confirmed to me that my passions and skill lend themselves greatly to more of a technology-based role."
